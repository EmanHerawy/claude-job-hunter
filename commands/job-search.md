# Job Search — Search ATS Boards & Auto-Evaluate

Search Ashby and Greenhouse public job board APIs for matching roles, filter across multiple dimensions, and auto-evaluate approved matches using the same pipeline as `/should-i-apply`.

## Inputs

**Usage:** `/job-search "company1, company2" "role-keywords"`

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as up to two quoted strings:
- **First quoted string** (optional) — Comma-separated list of company names or board tokens to search
- **Second quoted string** (optional) — Comma-separated role keyword filters (e.g., `"security, platform, infrastructure"`)

If no arguments are provided, fall back to the watchlist file. If no watchlist exists, ask the user interactively for companies and keywords.

## Setup

Resolve paths by checking (in order):
1. Read `~/.claude/.claude-job-hunter.conf` for `WORK_DIR`, `REPO_DIR`, and component paths
2. Fall back: `$CLAUDE_JOB_HUNTER_DIR` → `./claude-job-hunter/` → `~/claude-job-hunter/`

Required paths:
- **Profile:** `[PROFILE_DIR]/candidate-profile.md`
- **Watchlist:** `[WORK_DIR]/WATCHLIST.md`
- **Search log:** `[WORK_DIR]/JOB_SEARCH_LOG.md`
- **Evaluations dir:** `[EVALUATIONS_DIR]/`
- **Resources dir:** `[RESOURCES_DIR]/` (research checklists)
- **Watchlist template:** `[REPO_DIR]/resources/watchlist-template.md`

If the config exists, use its paths. Otherwise, use `[claude-job-hunter]/` as both repo and working directory.

If nothing is found, ask the user to run `/setup` first or provide the path.

## Workflow

Execute these phases in order. Present findings to the user after each phase for confirmation before proceeding.

---

### Phase 1: Setup & Configuration

1. Resolve all paths using the standard method above
2. Read the candidate profile at `[PROFILE_DIR]/candidate-profile.md`
   - If no profile exists, tell the user to run `/build-profile` first
3. Read the watchlist at `[WORK_DIR]/WATCHLIST.md`
   - If no watchlist exists, copy the template from `[REPO_DIR]/resources/watchlist-template.md` to `[WORK_DIR]/WATCHLIST.md`
   - Tell the user a watchlist was created and offer to configure it now or proceed with arguments
4. Read the search log at `[WORK_DIR]/JOB_SEARCH_LOG.md` (if it exists) for deduplication
5. Build the search plan by merging:
   - Companies from arguments (first quoted string, comma-separated)
   - Companies from watchlist `## Companies` section
   - Deduplicate company list
6. Build filter set by merging:
   - Role keywords from arguments (second quoted string, comma-separated)
   - Global filters from watchlist `## Search Filters` section
   - Per-company filter overrides from watchlist (if a company entry has its own `Filters:` line)
7. Present the search plan to the user:

```
Job Search Plan

Companies to search: [list]
Role keywords: [list]
Department keywords: [list]
Description keywords: [list]
Work modality: [list or "any"]
Location: [list or "any"]
Employment type: [list or "any"]

Previously searched: [count from log] jobs already in log
```

**Confirm with user before proceeding.**

---

### Phase 2: ATS Platform Discovery

For each company in the search plan, determine whether they use Ashby or Greenhouse and find the board token.

**Resolution order for each company:**

1. **Check watchlist first** — if the company entry has `Platform: ashby` or `Platform: greenhouse` AND a `Board token:` value, use those directly. Skip discovery for this company.

2. **Try Ashby API** — attempt to fetch:
   ```
   GET https://api.ashbyhq.com/posting-api/job-board/{token}?includeCompensation=true
   ```
   Try these token variants (in order):
   - Company name as-is, lowercased (e.g., `anthropic`)
   - Company name hyphenated (e.g., `palo-alto-networks`)
   - Company name without spaces (e.g., `paloaltonetworks`)
   - Common abbreviations if obvious (e.g., `pan` for Palo Alto Networks)

   A successful response (HTTP 200 with job data) confirms Ashby.

3. **Try Greenhouse API** — attempt to fetch:
   ```
   GET https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{token}/jobs?content=true
   ```
   Try the same token variants as above.

   A successful response (HTTP 200 with job data) confirms Greenhouse.

4. **WebSearch fallback** — if neither API responds:
   - Search for `"{company name}" careers site` or `"{company name}" jobs board`
   - Look for URLs containing `jobs.ashbyhq.com/{token}`, `boards.greenhouse.io/{token}`, or `jobs.lever.co/{token}`
   - Extract the board token from the URL
   - Confirm by hitting the appropriate API with the extracted token

5. **Give up gracefully** — if no ATS board is found after all attempts:
   - Report: `"⚠ {company}: No Ashby or Greenhouse board found. Skipping."`
   - Suggest the user check the careers page manually and add the token to their watchlist

**Output:** Present discovery results:

```
ATS Discovery Results

✓ Anthropic — Ashby (token: anthropic)
✓ Cloudflare — Greenhouse (token: cloudflare)
✗ Acme Corp — No board found (skipping)

Proceeding with [N] companies. Continue?
```

**Confirm with user before proceeding.**

### Phase 3: Fetch & Filter Jobs

For each confirmed company/platform, fetch all jobs and apply filters.

#### 3a. Fetch Jobs

**Ashby:** `GET https://api.ashbyhq.com/posting-api/job-board/{token}?includeCompensation=true`

Response structure (extract from `jobs` array):
```json
{
  "title": "Security Engineer",
  "location": "San Francisco, CA",
  "department": "Engineering",
  "team": "Security",
  "employmentType": "FullTime",
  "workplaceType": "Remote",  // or "Hybrid", "OnSite"
  "compensation": { ... },
  "descriptionPlain": "...",
  "jobUrl": "https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/...",
  "secondaryLocations": [...]
}
```

**Greenhouse:** `GET https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{token}/jobs?content=true`

Response structure (extract from `jobs` array):
```json
{
  "title": "Security Engineer",
  "location": { "name": "San Francisco, CA" },
  "departments": [{ "name": "Engineering" }],
  "content": "<p>Job description HTML...</p>",
  "absolute_url": "https://boards.greenhouse.io/...",
  "metadata": [...]
}
```

#### 3b. Normalize to Common Schema

Convert both API responses to a unified format for filtering:

| Field | Ashby Source | Greenhouse Source |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | `title` | `title` |
| `location` | `location` | `location.name` |
| `secondaryLocations` | `secondaryLocations` | — |
| `department` | `department` + `team` | `departments[].name` |
| `workplaceType` | `workplaceType` | Infer from `location.name` (look for "Remote", "Hybrid") |
| `employmentType` | `employmentType` | Infer from `metadata` or title |
| `description` | `descriptionPlain` | Strip HTML from `content` |
| `compensation` | `compensation` | Infer from `content` if present |
| `jobUrl` | `jobUrl` | `absolute_url` |
| `company` | (from search plan) | (from search plan) |
| `platform` | `ashby` | `greenhouse` |

For Greenhouse `workplaceType` inference:
- If location contains "Remote" → `Remote`
- If location contains "Hybrid" → `Hybrid`
- Otherwise → `OnSite`

#### 3c. Apply Filters

Filters are applied as **AND across dimensions, OR within each dimension**:

- **Role keywords** → case-insensitive substring match on `title`. If multiple keywords, match ANY.
- **Department keywords** → case-insensitive match on `department`. If multiple keywords, match ANY.
- **Description keywords** → case-insensitive match on plain text `description`. If multiple keywords, match ANY.
- **Work modality** → exact match on `workplaceType` (`Remote`, `Hybrid`, `OnSite`). If multiple values, match ANY.
- **Location** → case-insensitive substring match on `location` + `secondaryLocations`. If multiple locations, match ANY.
- **Employment type** → normalized match on `employmentType`. Map variants: `FullTime`/`Full-time`/`Full Time` → `FullTime`, etc. If multiple types, match ANY.

If a filter dimension is empty/unset, skip it (match all).

Example: Role keywords = `["security", "platform"]` AND Work modality = `["Remote"]` means:
- Title must contain "security" OR "platform"
- AND workplaceType must be "Remote"
- AND all other unset filters are ignored

#### 3d. Deduplicate Against Search Log

- Read previous entries from `JOB_SEARCH_LOG.md`
- Use `jobUrl` as the dedup key
- Mark each match as:
  - **NEW** — not seen in any previous search run
  - **PREVIOUSLY_SEEN** — URL exists in a prior run (include the date and status from that run)

#### 3e. Present Results

Display filtered results as a numbered table:

```
Job Search Results — [date]

[N] matches found across [M] companies ([X] new, [Y] previously seen)

 #  | Status | Company     | Title                  | Location        | Type   | Department
----|--------|-------------|------------------------|-----------------|--------|----------
 1  | NEW    | Anthropic   | Security Engineer      | SF (Remote OK)  | Full   | Security
 2  | NEW    | Anthropic   | Platform Engineer      | NYC             | Full   | Platform
 3  | SEEN   | Cloudflare  | Security Architect     | Remote          | Full   | Security
 4  | NEW    | Cloudflare  | Staff Security Eng     | Austin          | Full   | Engineering

Filtered out: [N] jobs didn't match filters
```

If no matches found, report and offer to adjust filters.

**Confirm with user before proceeding.**

---

### Phase 4: User Confirmation

Let the user select which matches to evaluate:

```
Which matches would you like to evaluate?

Enter numbers (e.g., "1, 2, 4"), "all new", or "none":
```

Options:
- **Specific numbers** — evaluate those matches
- **"all new"** — evaluate all NEW matches (skip PREVIOUSLY_SEEN)
- **"all"** — evaluate everything including previously seen
- **"none"** — skip evaluation, just log results

Before confirming selections, offer: `"Want to see the full JD for any match? Enter a number to preview."`

If the user requests a JD preview:
- Display the full description text for that match
- Then re-ask for evaluation selections

---

### Phase 5: Auto-Evaluate Pipeline

For each approved match, run the `/should-i-apply` evaluation pipeline. This produces the same output structure but adapts to the ATS context (JD already fetched, company research can be shared).

#### 5a. Group by Company

Group selected matches by company. This allows sharing `COMPANY_INTEL.md` across multiple roles at the same company.

#### 5b. For Each Company Group

**Company research (once per company):**
- Check if `[EVALUATIONS_DIR]/[company]-*/COMPANY_INTEL.md` already exists from a previous evaluation
  - If yes and it's less than 30 days old, reuse it
  - If yes but older, do a lighter refresh (check for recent news only)
  - If no, run full company research using both research checklists:
    - `[RESOURCES_DIR]/research-checklist.md`
    - `[RESOURCES_DIR]/interview-research-checklist.md`
- Save to `[EVALUATIONS_DIR]/[company]-[first-role-slug]/COMPANY_INTEL.md`

**For each role at this company:**

1. Create output directory: `[EVALUATIONS_DIR]/[company]-[role-slug]/`
2. Read the candidate profile
3. Use the job description already fetched from the API (Phase 3) — no need to re-fetch
4. Run the evaluation pipeline (same phases as `/should-i-apply` Phase 4 and Phase 5):

   **Generate SCORECARD.md:**
   - Overall verdict: Strong Yes / Yes / Maybe / Probably Not / No
   - Match score with justification
   - Sentiment-driven SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats)
   - Requirements scorecard table
   - Company card

   **Generate INTERVIEW_PREP.md:**
   - Likely interview panel
   - Questions they'll ask (with answer frameworks from candidate experience)
   - Questions to ask them (with good/bad answer signals)
   - Conversation points to weave in
   - Red flags to watch for
   - Culture & values alignment map

   **Copy or symlink COMPANY_INTEL.md** if shared with another role at same company

   **Generate README.md:**
   - Company, role, evaluation date
   - Verdict summary
   - File descriptions
   - Source: `/job-search` auto-evaluation (with JD URL)

5. Present a brief verdict summary after each evaluation:

```
Evaluation: [Company] — [Role]
Verdict: [Strong Yes / Yes / Maybe / Probably Not / No] ([score]%)
Top strength: [one line]
Top risk: [one line]
Output: [path to evaluation directory]
```

6. **Confirm between evaluations:**

```
Continue to next evaluation? (yes / skip remaining / stop)
```

- **yes** — proceed to next match
- **skip remaining** — stop evaluating but still log all matches
- **stop** — stop entirely, log what's done so far

---

### Phase 6: Update Search Log

After all evaluations (or skips) are complete, update `[WORK_DIR]/JOB_SEARCH_LOG.md`.

#### 6a. Create or Update Log

If the file doesn't exist, create it with a header:

```markdown
# Job Search Log

Automated search history from `/job-search`. Each run is prepended below.

---
```

#### 6b. Prepend New Run Section

Prepend (not append) the new run section so the most recent search is always at the top:

```markdown
## Search Run — [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]

**Search parameters:**
- Companies: [list]
- Role keywords: [list]
- Filters: [summary of active filters]

**Results:** [N] jobs scanned, [M] matches, [E] evaluated, [S] skipped

| # | Company | Title | URL | Status | Verdict | Score |
|---|---------|-------|-----|--------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Anthropic | Security Engineer | [url] | EVALUATED | Yes | 78% |
| 2 | Anthropic | Platform Engineer | [url] | SKIPPED | — | — |
| 3 | Cloudflare | Security Architect | [url] | PREVIOUSLY_SEEN | — | — |

---
```

Status values:
- **EVALUATED** — full evaluation produced (include verdict and score)
- **SKIPPED** — matched filters but user chose not to evaluate
- **PREVIOUSLY_SEEN** — appeared in a prior search run (include date first seen)
- **FILTERED_OUT** — did not match filters (only include count, not individual entries)

#### 6c. Detect Closed Listings

Compare the current API results against previous log entries for the same company:
- If a job URL from a previous run is no longer in the API response, mark it as **CLOSED** in the log
- Add a note: `"[CLOSED as of YYYY-MM-DD] — no longer on {company} job board"`
- Do NOT delete old entries — just annotate them

#### 6d. Offer Watchlist Updates

If any companies were discovered via WebSearch (not from the watchlist), offer to add them:

```
Discovered ATS boards not in your watchlist:
  - Anthropic → Ashby (token: anthropic)
  - Cloudflare → Greenhouse (token: cloudflare)

Add these to your watchlist? (yes/no)
```

If yes, append the company entries to `[WORK_DIR]/WATCHLIST.md` using the watchlist format.

---

### Phase 7: Summary Report

Present a final summary:

```
Job Search Complete — [date]

Companies searched:  [N]
  Successful:        [N] ([list])
  No board found:    [N] ([list])

Jobs scanned:        [N]
Matches found:       [N] (after filters)
  New:               [N]
  Previously seen:   [N]

Evaluations:         [N]
  Strong Yes:        [N]
  Yes:               [N]
  Maybe:             [N]
  Probably Not:      [N]
  No:                [N]

Skipped:             [N]

Top matches:
  1. [Company] — [Role] — [verdict] ([score]%) → [eval dir path]
  2. ...

Next steps:
  - /mock-interview "[company]" "[role]" — practice for your top match
  - /comp-research "[company]" "[role]" — check compensation before applying
  - /player-card "[company]" "[role]" — build a showcase site to send with your application
  - Edit WATCHLIST.md to refine filters for next search
  - Re-run /job-search to check for new postings

Search log: [path to JOB_SEARCH_LOG.md]
```
